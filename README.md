# saveherfromcancer
With our website SAVE HER FROM CANCER we have made an attempt to help women fight against cancer. We have provided a basic knowledge about the cancer â€“ its risk factors, prevention, early diagnosis and treatment. It  will help women to have an understanding about their disease.

     We have added some organisations with us, that supports and cooperates us to continue our fight. We also provide and collect donations to support the needy. Through our website, one can easily authenticate and connect with us to take part in such a holy task that helps humanity.

     We are completely transparent about the donation money. We have provided complete information about the donation money - collected and distributed.
     We have tried to make our website dynamic so the newly updated data can also be shown through it.
